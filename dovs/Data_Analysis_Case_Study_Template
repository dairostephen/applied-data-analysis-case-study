Exploratory Analysis of School Payments & Attendance
Decision-Support Case Study
Context

This case study analyzes operational school data to support administrative decision-making related to fee compliance and student attendance. The goal is to understand observable patterns while acknowledging real-world data limitations.

Dataset

Source: Anonymized operational school records

Scope: Single academic term

Records: Student-level data

Key Fields: Class, Payment Status, Amount Paid, Expected Fee, Attendance Rate

Key Findings

Students with unpaid or partially paid fees exhibit noticeably lower average attendance than fully paid students.

Outstanding fee balances are not evenly distributed and are concentrated within specific classes.

Payment compliance varies by class, suggesting targeted financial monitoring may be more effective than uniform interventions.

What the Data Cannot Tell Us

Whether unpaid fees cause lower attendance or are correlated due to external factors.

The role of household income, financial hardship, or policy enforcement.

Long-term behavioral trends beyond the analyzed term.

Recommendations

Use payment and attendance data together as a monitoring tool rather than a punitive measure.

Focus administrative attention on classes with higher outstanding balances.

Combine quantitative analysis with qualitative follow-ups to understand root causes.

Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how structured exploration of operational data can inform administrative judgment while remaining transparent about uncertainty and limitations.
