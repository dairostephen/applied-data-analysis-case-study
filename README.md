# Applied Data Analysis Case Study
## School Payments & Attendance

### 1. Problem Statement
This analysis explores school payment and attendance data to understand patterns in fee compliance
and how these patterns may support administrative decision-making.

### 2. Data Overview
The dataset contains anonymized student records including class, payment status, fee amounts,
and attendance rates.

### 3. Key Questions
- What proportion of students have fully paid their fees?
- Are partial or unpaid fees associated with lower attendance?
- Which classes show higher financial risk?

### 4. Data Quality & Limitations
- Small sample size limits generalization.
- Attendance does not capture reasons for absence.
- Payment data reflects a single academic term.

### 5. Summary of Findings
- Students with unpaid or partially paid fees show lower average attendance compared to fully paid students.
- Outstanding fee balances are concentrated in specific classes.
- Payment compliance varies meaningfully across class groups.

### 6. Recommendations
- Prioritize follow-up and engagement strategies for classes with higher outstanding balances.
- Monitor attendance patterns alongside payment status as an early risk indicator.
- Avoid assuming causation; supplement analysis with qualitative insights where possible.
