Applied Data Analysis Case Study
School Payments & Attendance
1. Problem Statement

This analysis examines school payment and attendance data to understand patterns in fee compliance and student attendance, and how these insights can support administrative decision-making under real-world constraints.

2. Data Overview

The dataset contains anonymized student-level records across multiple classes, including payment status, amount paid versus expected fees, and attendance rates for a single academic term.

3. Key Questions

What proportion of students have fully paid their fees?

Is there a relationship between payment status and attendance?

Which classes represent higher financial risk due to unpaid fees?

4. Data Quality & Limitations

The dataset represents a single academic term and a small sample size.

Attendance data does not capture reasons for absence.

No socio-economic or external contextual factors are included.

The analysis identifies associations, not causation.

5. Summary of Findings

Students with unpaid or partially paid fees show lower average attendance compared to fully paid students.

Outstanding fee balances are concentrated in specific classes.

Payment compliance varies meaningfully across class groups.

6. Recommendations

Prioritize follow-up and engagement strategies for classes with higher outstanding balances.

Monitor attendance patterns alongside payment status as an early risk indicator.

Avoid assuming causation; supplement analysis with qualitative insights where possible.

Exploratory Analysis of School Payments & Attendance
Decision-Support Case Study
Context

This case study analyzes operational school data to support administrative decision-making related to fee compliance and student attendance. The goal is to understand observable patterns while acknowledging real-world data limitations.

Dataset

Source: Anonymized operational school records

Scope: Single academic term

Records: Student-level data

Key Fields: Class, Payment Status, Amount Paid, Expected Fee, Attendance Rate

Key Findings

Students with unpaid or partially paid fees exhibit noticeably lower average attendance than fully paid students.

Outstanding fee balances are not evenly distributed and are concentrated within specific classes.

Payment compliance varies by class, suggesting targeted financial monitoring may be more effective than uniform interventions.

What the Data Cannot Tell Us

Whether unpaid fees cause lower attendance or are correlated due to external factors.

The role of household income, financial hardship, or policy enforcement.

Long-term behavioral trends beyond the analyzed term.

Recommendations

Use payment and attendance data together as a monitoring tool rather than a punitive measure.

Focus administrative attention on classes with higher outstanding balances.

Combine quantitative analysis with qualitative follow-ups to understand root causes.

Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how structured exploration of operational data can inform administrative judgment while remaining transparent about uncertainty and limitations.
